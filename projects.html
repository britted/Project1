Using the principles learned in control systems, different types of controllers were used, PD, PID, etc. These different controllers had different effects on the the system and a combination of them were used to allow the ball and beam to properly come to a dyanmic equilibrium. In the end, the formulas derived and the constant values found helped make the ball and beam system balance the ball and allowed it to move the ball to a desried location and hold it there.

The project was broken up into multiple parts that all added up to the final result - allowing the robot to control the second link by only manipulating the first link.Kinematics and energy principles were the key elements used in this project. The second link, or arm, of the robot needed to stand vertically upwards and was controlled by moving the first link of the robot. The location, or state, of the second arm was always recorded and that state determined the actions of the first arm. When the project was completed, the second arm was able to stay vertically upward as long as the program was running, and would even snap back into this position when preturbed by any force. </p>

The goal of this device is to allow the patient to monitor his or her knee stretches, as well as to provide feedback to the user through a graphical user interface (GUI) detailing his or her progress, while motivating the patient through alerts to continue stretching in order to avoid more costly surgeries. However, this device is only meant to be used to monitor certain types of knee stretches that primarily consist of measuring the angle of the knee during bending and/or the level of the leg during leg raise exercises. The device will not be used to transmit patient data to third parties, such as the patient's medical provider or physical therapist in order to comply with HIPAA regulations.

Accoustic source location, data acquisition, signal processing, and BCI data anylsis were the principles at the foundation of this project. First, using LabView, the location of the accoustic source was found, then the location of the source with respect to the robots were determined, and then the robots were programmed to rotate and move the the source. Then in Matlab, the EEG data was collected, with the Emotiv headset, and analyzed to create distinct movement profiles for each defined movement - the movements of interest were moving the head left and right. These movement profiles were then incorporated to the LabView code to control the movements of the robot.</p>
