          <p>As a McKelvey Scholar I have done research topics in various areas. Mostly, the projects were conducted individually, but one was with a group. These projects display my critical thinking and analysis skills.

Accoustic source location, data acquisition, signal processing, and BCI data anylsis were the principles at the foundation of this project. First, using LabView, the location of the accoustic source was found, then the location of the source with respect to the robots were determined, and then the robots were programmed to rotate and move the the source. Then in Matlab, the EEG data was collected, with the Emotiv headset, and analyzed to create distinct movement profiles for each defined movement - the movements of interest were moving the head left and right. These movement profiles were then incorporated to the LabView code to control the movements of the robot.</p>

As a final research project, did a case study that aimed to reproduce the results found in the study by David Arthur and Sergei Vassilvitskii, which analyzes the efficiency of the k means clustering algorithms based on different values of the variable k. The techniques used were various implementations of the k means and k means++ algorithms. The k means++ algorithm is a combined algorithm based on the fundamental principles of the k means algorithm, but differs in its initialization. The correctness off each these models were analyzed after implementation. This study attempts to recreate the results found by Arthur and Vassilvitskii. by implementing the three algorithms and classifying the models produced. Notwithstanding the multiple factors that hinder the precision of the reproduction of the results, the overall results were comparable to what were found by Arthur and Vassilvitskii.</p>

We applied two main classification models, which are k-nearest-neighbor model and na√Øve-bayes classification model. Initially, we pre-processed the data by reading and splitting the email into different strings. Then cleaned and tidied those strings and deleted the terms with no meaning. Finally, we use the hash tables to combine those similar strings into one string in order to make the total size of term-list file smaller. After we finished the pre-processing step, we applied those two classifications. Finally we evaluated those two classifications by testing those unknown emails. </p>

Brief descriptions of the production and resources needed to produce each were included in my final report. The economic and environmental effects were the main elements of comparison. My final conclusion that photovoltaic cells offered a more global solution, however neither could sustain life on its own - a combination of renewable energy sources would be the optimal solution.</p>
